## 0. What was assumed, and what is actually true

`docs/programme/00-BASELINE.md` and defect **D009** described this component as *"393 lines
carrying the platform's highest-consequence claim, unverified by any adversarial test."* Reading
it for this phase, **that framing was wrong in two ways and the record is corrected here rather
than quietly**:

| Assumed | Measured |
| :------ | :------- |
| "393 lines is not obviously enough to be that" | Line count was a poor proxy. The design is careful and deliberate: a real `isolated-vm` V8 isolate rather than `node:vm`, a capability model with **host-side** scope re-checks, no Prisma client or connection string or settable tenant id ever handed in, a frozen `unierp` global, and `finally { isolate.dispose() }`. |
| "unverified by any adversarial test" | `src/sandbox.spec.ts` has **18 targeted tests**, including one that specifically denies the `node:vm` escape one-liner the previous implementation allowed. |

**The real gap is narrower and more interesting than "it is thin".** The existing tests verify
the mitigations that were *designed*. They cannot verify mitigations that do not exist. Sections
2 and 3 below separate those two categories, and **nine threats currently have no mitigation at
all** — several of which matter more than the escapes that are covered.

`D009` is amended accordingly in the defect log. The severity stands; the reasoning changes.

---

## 1. The claims under test

`unierp-platform/ARCHITECTURE.md` step 6 states, verbatim:

> *"…its handler runs inside **`unierp-sandbox`** — a V8 isolate with no `process`, no
> `require`, no filesystem, and metered CPU, memory, query and egress budgets."*

That is seven distinct claims. `PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md § 8.3` adds a kill switch reachable
from the Platform Admin Console, and egress restricted to manifest-declared, admin-approved
hosts. **A16's exit criterion is that every one of those claims maps to a numbered threat with a
stated mitigation.** The mapping:

| Claim | Threats | Status |
| :---- | :------ | :----- |
| V8 isolate (not a shared context) | T01 | ✅ mitigated, tested |
| no `process` | T02 | ✅ mitigated, tested |
| no `require` | T02 | ✅ mitigated, tested |
| no filesystem | T02, T13 | ✅ blocked in the isolate **and** on the egress path (https-only scheme + public-IP resolution + redirect rejection) — **T13, A17** |
| metered **CPU** | T08, T09, T10 | ✅ real CPU via `isolate.cpuTime`, enforced during execution at every bridge hop, breaker separate from kill switch — **T14, T15, A17** |
| metered **memory** | T04, T11 | ✅ isolate heap capped, bridge byte budget on both directions, per-tenant + per-process concurrency caps — **T11, T19, A17** |
| metered **query** | T06, T14 | ✅ query *count*, `take` and row-count budgets at the host boundary — **T17, A17** |
| metered **egress** | T07, T13 | ✅ count and hostname capped, https-only, DNS-resolved public-IP check — **T13, A17** |
| kill switch, console-reachable | T12, T15 | ✅ revocation lives in a shared store (interface + fail-closed), breaker is a separate state — **T12, T16, A17** |
| admin-approved hosts only | T07 | ✅ mitigated, tested |

Four of the nine claims are only partly true today, and two are materially false in a
multi-replica deployment. **None of that is visible from the tests, because the tests assert
what was built.**

---

## 2. Threats that ARE mitigated

Recorded so A17 does not weaken them and A18 keeps a test for each. Each row's mitigation is
present in `src/index.ts` and asserted in `src/sandbox.spec.ts`.

| # | Threat | Mitigation | Test |
| :- | :----- | :--------- | :--- |
| **T01** | **Context escape.** `this.constructor.constructor("return process")().mainModule.require("fs")` — the classic `node:vm` break-out, which works because `node:vm` shares a heap and a global object with the host. | A genuine `isolated-vm` isolate: separate heap, separate global. There is no `process` identifier to reach. | ✅ *"denies the node:vm escape that the previous implementation allowed"* |
| **T02** | **Ambient authority.** Reaching `require`, `fetch`, `process`, timers, or any host global. | Nothing is injected but a single `ivm.Reference` bridge. No `module`/`exports` shim is provided — deliberately, since a mutable host-shaped object is how ambient authority creeps back. | ✅ *"has no require, no fetch, no process and no host globals"* |
| **T03** | **Capability forgery / privilege escalation.** Calling a capability the installation does not grant, or reaching one by patching the API object. | Scope checked **on the host side** at call time in every bridge branch, not only inside the isolate. Scopes are the intersection of the manifest request and the installing admin's own permissions. | ✅ three tests, including *"re-checks the scope on the host side, not only in the isolate"* |
| **T04** | **Heap exhaustion inside the isolate.** Allocating until the process dies. | `new ivm.Isolate({ memoryLimit: budget.memoryMb })`, default 32 MB, hard cap 512. | ✅ *"enforces the isolate memory cap"* |
| **T05** | **Global tampering.** Replacing `unierp.data.read` with a shim to intercept or re-route. | `Object.freeze` on each sub-object and the root, plus `defineProperty(globalThis,'unierp',{writable:false,configurable:false})`. | ✅ *"freezes the unierp global so an extension cannot replace a capability"* |
| **T06** | **Query flooding.** Issuing unbounded reads/writes in one invocation. | `queriesPerInvocation`, default 50, hard cap 1,000, charged before the host call. | ✅ *"caps queries per invocation"* |
| **T07** | **Unapproved egress.** HTTP to a host the installing admin never approved. | `assertEgressAllowed` — hostname must be in the install-time approved set. A manifest cannot approve itself. | ✅ two tests, allow and deny |
| **T08a** | **Infinite loop.** `while(true){}`. | `timeout: budget.timeoutMs` on every `eval`/`run`/`apply`, default 1,000 ms, hard cap 30 s. Bounds a *single entry* — see T09 for what it does not bound. | ✅ *"enforces a wall-clock deadline on a runaway loop"* |
| **T09a** | **Tenant forgery.** Influencing which tenant's data a query reads. | The host re-derives tenant from the installation. The isolate has no way to set it; RLS then applies to extension queries exactly as to first-party ones. | ✅ *"never lets the isolate choose its own tenant"* |
| **T10a** | **Continuing after revocation.** | `disable()` marks dead, disposes, and every later call fails closed. | ✅ *"fails closed once the kill switch is thrown"* — but see **T12** |

## 3. Threats with NO mitigation — A17's actual scope

**These nine were the phase's real output. All nine are now mitigated and tested by
A17** (`src/index.ts` + `src/hardening.spec.ts`); each row records what changed. The
following entries describe each threat as filed by A16, with the A17 mitigation noted
in the block quote.

### T11 · 🔴 Host heap exhaustion through the bridge — no payload size budget

Bridge arguments and results cross as JSON: `JSON.stringify(args)` in the isolate,
`JSON.parse(argsJson)` on the host, and the reverse on the way back. **Nothing caps the size of
either.**

An extension inside a 32 MB isolate can construct a ~30 MB string and pass it to `data.write`,
or return it from a hook. The host then parses it on the **host** heap, which has no per-extension
cap at all. Repeated across concurrent invocations this is an OOM on the API process — which
takes down every tenant, not just the offender.

> **A17 must add:** a byte budget on bridge arguments and results, charged before
> `JSON.parse` on the host side, and a budget field alongside `memoryMb`. The check must be on
> the *serialised* length, before parsing — checking after parsing is checking after the damage.

> **A17 (DONE):** every bridge payload (`argsJson`) is byte-capped on the **host**
> before `JSON.parse`, and every serialised result handed back is byte-capped too;
> both limits live in `SandboxInstallation.hardening.bridgeBytes`, clamped to a safe
> range by `resolveHardening()`. The hook return value now crosses by isolated-vm
> copy semantics (see T18), so the only strings the host parses are the ones it
> budgets.

### T12 · 🔴 The kill switch is per-process, so it does not work

`disabled` and `cpuWindow` are instance fields on `SandboxRunner`:

```ts
private disabled = new Set<string>();
private cpuWindow = new Map<string, { windowStart: number; cpuMs: number }>();
```

In any deployment with more than one API replica — which is every production deployment — each
replica holds its own set. **Calling `disable()` on one replica leaves the extension running on
every other.** `PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE § 8.3` requires the kill switch to be reachable from the
Platform Admin Console; an operator who uses it would see it succeed and the extension would
keep executing.

This is the single most dangerous finding in this document, because it is the control an operator
reaches for **during an incident**, and it would appear to work.

> **A17 must move revocation to shared state** (the database, or Redis with a database
> fallback) and fail **closed** when that state is unreachable. An extension whose status cannot
> be confirmed must not run.

> **A17 (DONE):** revocation is a `RevocationStore` the runner is constructed with;
> `run()` re-reads it on every entry and **fails closed** — a store that cannot be
> reached reads as disabled. `InMemoryRevocationStore` exists for dev/tests; the
> platform supplies a database/Redis-backed implementation, and two runners sharing
> one store provably see each other's revocations (tested).

### T13 · 🔴 The hostname allowlist is not SSRF protection

`assertEgressAllowed` resolves nothing — it compares `new URL(url).hostname` against a string
set. That leaves open:

- **DNS rebinding.** An approved hostname the extension's author controls, resolving to
  `169.254.169.254` (cloud instance metadata), `127.0.0.1`, or a private RFC 1918 address. The
  hostname check passes; the request reaches the host's own network.
- **Redirects.** The allowlist is checked once, on the initial URL. If `host.httpFetch` follows
  redirects, the final destination is unchecked.
- **The filesystem claim.** `ARCHITECTURE.md` says "no filesystem". A `file://` URL, or an
  approved host redirecting to one, would depend entirely on what `host.httpFetch` accepts —
  which the sandbox does not constrain. **The "no filesystem" claim is therefore true of the
  isolate and unproven of the egress path.**

> **A17 must:** resolve the hostname and reject non-public IP ranges *after* resolution and
> before connection, pin the resolved address for the request, disable redirect-following or
> re-check every hop, and allowlist schemes to `https:` only.

> **A17 (DONE):** `assertEgressAllowed` is now async and resolves the hostname
> (injectable resolver, default `node:dns`), rejecting any address that is loopback,
> private RFC 1918, link-local, cloud-metadata `169.254.169.254`, CGNAT, multicast or
> reserved — before the host fetcher is called. The scheme is restricted to `https:`
> (which also closes the `file://` filesystem hole), and 3xx redirect responses are
> rejected. Two host contracts remain with the platform's HTTP client: it must not
> follow redirects, and must connect to the validated address; the sandbox enforces
> everything it can observe. DNS rebinding and metadata exfiltration are blocked and
> tested.

### T14 · 🟠 CPU is metered in wall-clock time, including time it did not use

```ts
const started = process.hrtime.bigint();
…
usage.cpuMs = Number(process.hrtime.bigint() - started) / 1e6;
```

`hrtime` is **wall clock**. The measured span includes every host callback the invocation waited
on — a slow database query, a 900 ms HTTP call. So:

- An extension that calls one slow API is billed CPU it never consumed, and can be
  auto-disabled by `chargeCpu` for someone else's latency.
- An extension doing genuine CPU work while awaiting nothing is measured correctly by accident.
- The field is named `cpuMs` and the budget `cpuMsPerMinute`, so every consumer of
  `InvocationUsage` — billing, alerting, circuit-breaking — inherits the error.

> **A17 must** either measure real CPU (`isolate.getHeapStatistics()` / isolated-vm's
> `cpuTime` and `wallTime`, which it exposes precisely for this) or rename the field and budget
> to `wallMs` and stop claiming CPU is metered. **Either is honest; the present state is not.**

> **A17 (DONE):** `usage.cpuMs` is now the delta of `isolate.cpuTime` — real CPU,
> in nanoseconds per isolated-vm — accrued at every bridge hop and at completion.
> Time spent awaiting a slow host callback is no longer billed to the extension
> (tested: a 400 ms slow read bills < 200 ms CPU). The field name now means what it
> says.

### T15 · 🟠 The CPU budget is only enforced between invocations

`assertCpuWindow` runs at entry and `chargeCpu` after completion. Within one invocation the only
bound is `timeoutMs`. So a single call may consume up to 30 s (the hard cap) regardless of a
`cpuMsPerMinute` of 100, and the breaker trips only afterwards.

Worse, `chargeCpu` calls `this.disable(extensionId)` to trip the breaker — reusing the operator
kill switch as a rate limiter. An automatic breaker and a deliberate revocation become
indistinguishable, and `enable()` clears both.

> **A17 must** enforce the budget *during* execution (isolated-vm's execution timeout combined
> with a periodic CPU check), and **separate** the automatic breaker from the operator kill
> switch — two states, two reasons, two audit trails.

> **A17 (DONE):** CPU is charged *during* execution at every host hop (a check that
> would stop the next capability the moment the invocation's share of the window is
> spent; a pure synchronous burn is still bounded by the execution `timeout`). The
> automatic breaker is a **separate state** from the operator kill switch: tripping
> it never sets `disable()`, `enable()` never clears it, and it clears only when the
> accounting window rolls over. Both behaviours are tested.

### T16 · 🟠 Revocation is not persisted

`disabled` is in-memory. A process restart re-enables every extension disabled by an operator
*and* every one auto-disabled by the breaker. A rolling deploy silently clears all revocations.

> **A17:** revocation is a persisted fact, re-read on start, fail-closed if unreadable. Same
> mechanism as T12.

> **A17 (DONE):** same mechanism as T12 — revocation is a persisted fact read on
> every entry. A seeded store denies on a fresh runner (no process restart can clear
> it), and an unreachable store denies (fail-closed). Both are tested.

### T17 · 🟠 Query cost is unbounded — only query *count* is capped

`dataRead(model, query)` charges one unit and forwards an arbitrary `query` object. Nothing
bounds what it asks for. Fifty queries is fifty full table scans, or fifty
`take: 1_000_000` reads, all inside the budget and all against a database shared with every
other tenant. This is the noisy-neighbour path **A20** exists for, arriving through the sandbox.

> **A17 must** bound result size and shape at the host boundary: a maximum `take`, a required
> index for any filter, a statement timeout on extension-issued queries, and a row-count budget
> alongside the query-count budget.

> **A17 (DONE):** at the host boundary the sandbox now caps the requested `take`
> (`hardening.maxTake`, checked before the host call) and the rows an invocation may
> fetch or write (`hardening.rowsPerInvocation`, counted on the result and reported
> in `usage.rows`), alongside the existing query-count cap. Requiring an index for
> every filter and the statement timeout remain host-side contracts of `dataRead`
> (the database layer), noted here because the sandbox has no schema knowledge.

### T18 · 🟡 A poisoned `JSON.stringify` lets the isolate control what the host parses

The invoke wrapper serialises the hook's return value **inside** the isolate:

```js
const out = hooks[hookName].apply(undefined, JSON.parse(argsJson));
return JSON.stringify(out === undefined ? null : out);
```

An extension may redefine `JSON.stringify` on its own global before returning. The wrapper then
calls the attacker's function, which may emit any string at all. The host does
`JSON.parse(String(raw))` and trusts the shape.

This is not an escape — the isolate boundary holds — but it means **the host cannot trust the
structure of an extension's return value**, and anything downstream that assumes a shape
(a database write, a rendered template, an event payload) is receiving attacker-controlled data
in a place the type system says is safe.

> **A17 must** transfer results as structured values via isolated-vm's own copy semantics
> (`result: { copy: true }` is already used on `apply` — the inner `JSON.stringify` should be
> removed entirely) or validate the parsed result against the hook's declared output schema on
> the host side. Prefer both.

> **A17 (DONE):** the inner `JSON.stringify` is gone. The hook invoker is installed
> by the bootstrap using the pristine `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse` captured before
> extension code runs, and its result crosses by isolated-vm's own copy semantics
> (`result: { copy: true, promise: true }`). The host never parses a string produced
> inside the isolate. Both the poisoned-stringify and poisoned-parse cases are
> tested.

### T19 · 🟡 No cap on concurrent isolates

`run()` creates an isolate per invocation with no limit on how many exist at once. Each reserves
up to `memoryMb`. A tenant triggering many concurrent hooks can reserve arbitrary host memory
without any single isolate exceeding its cap — the per-isolate budget is enforced and the
aggregate is not.

> **A17:** a per-tenant and per-process concurrent-isolate cap, with queueing or rejection, and
> isolate reuse where it is safe.

> **A17 (DONE):** a `ConcurrencyRegistry` accounts in-flight isolates per tenant and
> per process (`hardening.maxConcurrentIsolatesPerTenant` / `...PerProcess`), with
> the slot acquired **synchronously before any await** so the cap counts every
> isolate that is about to exist, and released in `finally`. Exceeding the cap is a
> `SandboxQuotaError` (rejection, not unbounded queueing). Tested with a cap of 1
> and two concurrent invocations.

## 4. Explicitly out of scope, with reasons

Stated so the boundary is a decision rather than an omission:

| Not defended against | Why |
| :------------------- | :-- |
| V8 zero-days | We inherit V8's boundary. Mitigation is patch latency, not design — which makes it an `A29`/dependency-update concern, not a sandbox one. |
| Spectre-class side channels | `SharedArrayBuffer` and high-resolution timers are not exposed to the isolate. Residual risk accepted; revisit if either is ever exposed. |
| A malicious *platform* operator | Outside the trust boundary by construction. The audit trail, not the sandbox, is the control (`C03`, `C04`). |
| Denial of service by legitimate volume | That is `A20`'s rate limiting, not the sandbox's budgets. The two must compose; **T17** is where they overlap. |

---

## 5. What A17, A18 and A19 must now deliver

**A17 — hardening.** Mitigate T11–T19. Do not weaken T01–T10. **✅ DONE (2026-08-08).**
T11–T19 are mitigated in `src/index.ts` and each has a behavioural test in
`src/hardening.spec.ts`; `npm run test:hardening` is the exit criterion and fails when
any mitigation is removed.

**A18 — the escape suite.** One test per threat, T01 through T19. **Each test must fail when its
mitigation is removed** — a test that passes unconditionally is the defect this whole programme
exists to eliminate, and the current 18 tests have not been checked for it. A18 must verify that
too, for the existing tests as well as the new ones. **✅ DONE (2026-08-08).**

**A19 — governor limits.** T12, T14, T15, T16, T17 and T19 are all budget-enforcement, and they
are the direct analogue of Apex governor limits. A19 is what makes tenants trust running
third-party code, and it is why `01-PRIORITY-AND-SEQUENCING § 3` blocks all thirty Track G phases
on this stage rather than on the builders.

**The three that must not ship without a fix, in this order:**

1. **T12** — the kill switch does not work in production, and an operator would believe it did.
2. **T13** — the hostname allowlist reads as SSRF protection and is not.
3. **T11** — one tenant's extension can OOM the process serving every tenant.

## 6. Amendment log

| Date | Change | By |
| :--- | :----- | :- |
| 2026-08-08 | A18 DONE — escape suite. `src/escape-suite.spec.ts`, 38 tests: for each threat T01–T19 one test attempts the escape and asserts containment, and a second test copies `src/index.ts`, applies a source mutation that removes exactly that threat's mitigation, loads it in a fresh module registry (unique path per mutation so vitest never serves a stale transform), and asserts the same payload now escapes. Each escape-succeeds test individually observed: T08a mutated timeout 2000 vs 300 ms loop completes; T07 mutated resolver-injected unapproved host reaches `httpFetch`; T04 mutated memoryLimit 512 hits "Script execution timed out."; T11 mutated bridge cap bypassed reaches `dataWrite`. Suite observed FAILING when the real T11 cap is removed (2 failed, source restored). Wired as a hard blocking CI step `Escape suite (A18)` with no `hashFiles` guard. Full suite 100/100, `tsc --noEmit` clean. | agent (A18) |
| 2026-08-08 | A17 DONE — hardening. All nine unmitigated threats now have a mitigation and a test: T11 bridge byte budget both directions; T12/T16 shared `RevocationStore` with fail-closed entry and persisted revocation; T13 https-only + DNS-resolved public-IP egress check + redirect rejection; T14 real CPU via `isolate.cpuTime` (was wall clock); T15 breaker separated from the kill switch and enforced during execution; T17 `take` + row-count budgets; T18 host never parses in-isolate serialisation (copy semantics + pristine captured JSON); T19 per-tenant/per-process `ConcurrencyRegistry`. New hardening knobs live on `SandboxInstallation.hardening` (the extension-api `ResourceBudgetSchema` is a published artifact and was not modified). Exit criterion `npm run test:hardening` — 44 tests, observed failing when the T11 cap is removed. T01–T10 untouched. Host-side contracts that remain (recorded per threat): redirect-following disabled in the host's HTTP client, and pinned/validated-address connection; index requirement and statement timeout in `dataRead`. | agent (A17) |
| 2026-08-07 | Established (A16). 19 threats; 10 mitigated and tested, 9 with no mitigation. Corrects D009's premise: the component is not thin or untested — it has 18 targeted tests — but the tests assert the mitigations that were designed, and nine threats were never designed for. T12 (per-process kill switch) and T13 (hostname allowlist mistaken for SSRF protection) are the findings that matter most. | Claude Code |
